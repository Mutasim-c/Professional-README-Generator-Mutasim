# Professional-README-Generator-Mutasim
A cmd line application that allows a user to create a read me file from a series of questions they answer

## Description
This application allows a user to type 'node index.js' and in return it will give them a series of question they would need to answer which will be the information needed for a read me file. Once all questions are answered then README.ms file is created with their information in.
All the code needed is in the develop file since if they were out in the main branch it would overide this read me file.

## Installation
Make your way to the directory where the index.js file is. Then run the command "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". then once the package is downloaded, run the command 'node index.js'. Then you will be presented with the questions.

## Important
Make sure you run the command 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' before running node index.js otherwise it wont work.
